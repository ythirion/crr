## Day 1: code that is easy to understand.

Welcome to the Advent of Craft 2023.

We begin this journey by going over the basics. 
We all do this everyday:

_Reading a simple code._ 

If you understand a piece of code quickly, 
it does not mean the code is readable much less well-crafted.
It also does not mean the code should not be refactored.

A readable code is not always the fewest line or the one 
that uses the latest framework technique.

Think about the real value your code should bring.

>**Challenge of day 1: Make your production code easier to understand.**

May the crafting journey begin!

- <u>ðŸ’¡HINT:</u> Your IDE is your best friend in this journey!
