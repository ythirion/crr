## Day 13: Building your data.

Today, your crafting journey will require you to upgrade your ship.
In order to do that, you will need to know new tools.

Today's exercise is on a known code base, one we have worked on before,
and we will take it to new heights by exploring new building techniques.

Your tests are correctly written but can use some optimizations.

Pay attention to what is being tested, what is required for the test to pass
and see what you can factorize.

>**Challenge of day 13: Find a way to eliminate the irrelevant, and amplify the essentials of those tests.**

May your crafting journey continue!

- <u>ðŸ’¡HINT:</u> Your tests always need the same type of objects.
