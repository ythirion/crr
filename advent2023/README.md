Christmas is here! 🎅

Your journey as a developer has probably taken many turns.

You probably had to troubleshoot and refactor a piece of code that you still have nightmares about.

You might have been stuck in a team when you never have time to improve your code base
because `"We have to deliver more features"`.

Heck, you probably still are.

We feel you, and in the spirit of Christmas, you deserve a gift.

We have the privilege this year to bring to you the Advent of Craft.
This is a journey into software craftsmanship.

Each day, `you will be taken in a small aspect of software craftsmanship`. Each day, you will
have `an exercise with a topic` to look at in a small bite approach and hopefully you will `learn something`.

From refactoring to testing to reviewing, all aspects are going to be explored.

> The objective of this journey is to learn new crafts and share with your peers, not to get lost in impossible
> algorithm exercises or to finish as fast as you can using chatGPT.

A repository is available and each day a topic will appear with a proposed solution for the day before.

We hope you enjoy the ride.
Happy Crafting!
