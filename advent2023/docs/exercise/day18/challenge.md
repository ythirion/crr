## Day 18: Prevent design failure.

Today, you ship is almost ready to depart for the last days.
As you are calling your crew, a feeling of insecurity is creeping.

You decide to double-check everything onboard before leaving.

Today's exercise is about challenging the design of your code but
mostly to be proactive at it.

You actually don't like to refactor a code that
could be avoided in the first place.

_Would that be nice to do it automatically?_

> **Day 18: Automatically detect Linguistic Anti-Patterns (LAP).**

May your crafting journey be sound!

- <u>ðŸ’¡HINT:</u> Read the ArchUnit documentation for Java.
