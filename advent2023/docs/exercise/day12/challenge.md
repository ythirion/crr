## Day 12: Planning for the future.

Today, the journey will demand us to plan, to think of the future
as we advance into challenging territories.

As you gather new knowledge and techniques, one thing remains: change.

Code that works are not always the best to maintain. Therefore,
an occasional analysis and refactoring are sometimes needed.

Today's exercise is about finding another approach, another design for your code.
Something that will make your code better compatible with new demands.

You may work your refactoring as far as you'd like, but remember the mantra:
_Your tests shall never fail..._

>**Challenge of day 12: Make your code open for extension.**

May your crafting journey be smooth!

- <u>ðŸ’¡HINT:</u> Your previous tests can't fail if you are testing a new method.
