## 🚀 D-1: Getting ready for your journey.

The Advent of Craft 2023 starts tomorrow.

A long journey awaits you.

In order to prepare your ship for this journey, here is a task
list of the things you need to know / install before setting sail.

### 🔨Install your tools

- Install an IDE. Intellij Community or VS Code should do.
- Create an account on github to get the latest changes and fork the repository.
- Install Git to get the repository. With a git bash or git client.
- Install and create an account on Discord to share with the community.

### ✅ The process

Each day, an exercise is going to be posted at around 1PM Europe time (GMT+1) 
in the public repository here:
https://github.com/advent-of-craft/advent-of-craft.git

At the same time, a solution for the exercise of the previous day 
is going to be posted.

The repository will have an _exercise/_ folder containing a subfolder for each day 
as well as a _solution/_ folder with step-by-step instructions.

### 👨‍💻Posting your solution

Each day, a dedicated channel in the Discord is going to be created for posting solutions.

We advise you to post your solution in order to benefit the whole community.
You can use the following methods to do so:

1) Post a screenshot of your solution in the Discord channel (via Codesnap or other tools).
2) Post your code in a markdown format.
   - You can wrap your code within this markdown
   ```java
      paste your code like this
   ```
3) From your github account you can create your own solution.
   - you can fork the following repository: https://github.com/advent-of-craft/advent-of-craft.git
   - post a link to your repository and solution in the Discord channel (can be with branches per day)

We encourage everyone to start healthy discussions on the Discord that are related
to the exercise of the day and any advice you want to share with the community.

### ❓Help on your journey

A help channel is available at any time on the Discord server.

If you get stuck with IDE configuration, git commands or anything that prevents you
from coding, please let us know, your hosts and the community will make everything
possible to help you.

### 🎙️Last word from your hosts

Remember that this initiative is completely free, and you can reuse these exercises
for your own crafting journey with the step-by-step solutions as well.

> We humbly ask you in return to approach the journey with an open mind,
a good will and that you respect the other passengers. The Discord is a safe
space where all conversations are open so let's all remember to be civilized.

We are all here to learn.

🎅 May this epic crafting journey begin! 🧑‍🎄
