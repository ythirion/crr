## Day 17: One and thousand tests.

Today, you are recovering at the nearby harbor to
replenish your ship before the last week on the journey.

Challenges are not going to lack and in order to face
them, new skills are required.

Today's exercise is about transforming your test in
a way you've not done before.

However, nothing is simple. You've got to think
of your tests and your code differently.

_What characteristic does my code have?_

> **Day 17: Design one test that has the impact of thousands.**

May your crafting journey bring you to new heights!

- <u>ðŸ’¡HINT:</u> What PBT stands for.
