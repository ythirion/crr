## Day 6: When too many tests is an issue.

Today, as you are doing repairs, you come across a known code. A code that looks
readable, yet when looking at the tests, you realize there are too many of them.

From day 3, you will take the code and try to factorize some logic.

The question of today's exercise is the following:

>**Challenge of day 6: Parameterize your tests.**

May your crafting journey continue!

- <u>ðŸ’¡HINT:</u> Assess the inputs and assertions.
