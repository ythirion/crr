## Day 25: Reflecting and sharing.

Still hungover from last night's celebration, it's time
to start reflecting on your journey.

What did you learn? What do I want my community to know?

Today is about sharing.

We invite the people who took this journey to fill out the 
feedback form (link in the comment).

We are celebrating Christmas and the craft in general, and we
would like you to make some noise on LinkedIn.

Please, share on social media (@adventofcraft) and the discord 
what your experience was like.

> **Challenge of day 25: Share with the world what you have learned.**

- <u>ðŸ’¡HINT:</u> Follow your intuition.
