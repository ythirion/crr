# Day 24: Write the most complicated code you can.

Let's learn a new development practice : [`Crappy-Driven Development`](https://github.com/ythirion/crappy-driven-development).

`The secret art of making yourself indispensable by writing crappy code!!!`

- Our objective : Apply CDD to make the code so crappy that other people won't be able to understand it
  - Follow the golden rules described below

### Let's apply it on `dive`
Here are some crappy ideas if necessary ðŸ˜‰

- All the code in 1 file
- Rename package and class names
- `Minify` names
- Add `unused variables` and `useless code`
- Add `commented code` in another programming language
- Use `misleading` names
- Add brainf*** `comment`
- Change pattern matching to `if else`

> We highly increased the complexity ðŸ¤©

- `Encrypt` business strings
  - Use `hashCode()` to do so

- `Kill` the formatter ðŸ˜œ

If you've done your job well, your code should be as wasted as you are...

>**Tip of the day: Go and rest...**
