## Day 1: Make your production code easier to understand.

### Encapsulate Conditionals

If conditionals are too complex, it might hamper readability.

1) Start by simplifying the code
2) Extract method for each part of the condition
3) Think deeply on the business to find names that represent it

Your code should look more readable and as a result more maintainable.

>**Tip of the day: the best documentation is the code itself.**
