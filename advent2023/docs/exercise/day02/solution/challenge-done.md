## Day 2: One level of indentation.

Here once again the IDE can help you organize your code.

### Decrease your code complexity

1) Start by inverting condition
2) Apply the same `safe` refactoring for the other `if` on input
3) We can remove the redundant else
4) We group the guard in the same condition

âœ… Challenge of the day checked

But it's the Advent Of Craft so we can do much better

### More optimisations

- Fight magic numbers by adding functional names.
- Extract the core complexity (modulo) into a single method.
- Extract your guard logic into an easy to read private method.

>**Tip of the day: break the complexity of your code down into small chunks.**
